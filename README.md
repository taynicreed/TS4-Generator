# TS4-Legacy-Challenge-Generator

TS4 Legacy Challenge Generator is a web application that can be used to generate a random 10-legacy challenge for The Sims 4 (TS4). The user can customize their results by selecting the add-on DLC that they own (expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs, and kits) before generating the rules. The application also offers a "reroll" and "undo" feature, which gives the user the option to tweak the rules for individual generations. When the user is happy with the rules they can save them as a text file. 

The application also includes a name generator, a microservice created by Sophia Lilienthal specifically for this project: https://github.com/sophlil/RandomNameGenerator

Demo video coming very soon!
